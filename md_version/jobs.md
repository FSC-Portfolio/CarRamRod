### Joshua Laver
My ideal job that I can see myself doing is cyber security for a company like AEMO, being the lead
defence and seeking out different hackers or trojans or worms designed to steal information from a
company that could hurt the company or its clientele. Being able to defend a company like in the tv
show Mr. Robot makes me excited to study the field and be able to have a career in cyber security.
To be able to qualify to successfully work in a cyber security job I would need a degree in an IT field
such as a bachelor’s in cyber security in Computer Science. You would need to be able to
demonstrate key understandings of network defence, firewall safety protocols and know how to
code in multiple languages in order to create complex algorithms to protect a server from a hack.
At the moment the skills I have include being able to encrypt a hard drive, being able to read code
and find different ways to make programming easier in the long run and finding the cause of most
problems on computers thanks to the teachings from my dad. I’m not yet qualified but I know how
to do most things in the qualification and if I can’t or don’t know how – I'll find the answer through
research and perseverance.
Currently I have a 10-step plan on how I’m going to obtain everything necessary to obtain a job in
defence or in game design. The first 4 steps involve me going to Uni to get a degree to further my
knowledge on everything computer related so I can feel confident in my abilities to give answers in
problem solving on computer servers and networks or on the programming side of things. Steps 5-8
involve me getting real world experience so I can start to develop and build a career for the rest of
my life and then steps 8-10 involve me starting my own firm that contracts for multiple companies.

A job as a professional pentester has so much appeal to me. Being able to breach companies systems with their permission is enticing and makes me excited for the possibilities of a future career. I have found there is a high demand for Cyber Security roles as the world of Cyberterrorism continues to grow and as society turns to IT solutions for all of their needs more and more, the importance of having safe secure data is detrimental. The fun thing about security is it is only a problem once it is a problem. Companies are starting to be awoken to the real threat insecure practices actually create as we hear more and more about malware and breaches on big companies. So a job as a white hat hacker or Ethical Hacker would be my ideal job. I am not too fussed which company I work for, starting my own cyber security agency isn't outside the realms of possibility either, but it would be good to understand networking from a transport layer perspective better before I make any solid advances in my desired field. I already have an advanced knowledge in application development and web server practices.
