### Joshua Laver
My name is Joshua Laver, I was born on the 17 th of January 1997. When I was a kid, I fell in love with 4 things, WWE, Football(soccer), Gaming and computers. The first time I ever played a game was way back in 2001 when my dad brought home the very first PlayStation 1 with Crash Bandicoot and Ratchet and Clank. Since then I have become a huge gamer, having over 2000 hours with some games like League of Legends(4671), FIFA and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. I love to work on computers as well, one of my favourite things to do as a kid was take apart my computer clean it and put it back together. I also love cooking, having taught myself thanks to Gordon Ramsey videos, I can now cook a mean steak, fish and even curries and risottos, I'll get there one day!

### Nathaniel Rogers
Glad you could stop on by and learn about our team! I’m Nathaniel Rogers (3829502), the Hopeful Pentester for Car RamRod. I hope to be a fancy white hat hacker for big companies in the future. The idea of breaching their systems, without the threat of jail would be pretty cool. You can catch me playing my guitar or jumping on trampolines when I’m not at my computer. I’ve got 3 years of fulltime developer experience making/maintaining ecommerce shops, so I am familiar with all technologies involved in hosting and Magento/WordPress applications.
