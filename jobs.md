### Joshua Laver
My ideal job that I can see myself doing is cyber security for a company like AEMO, being the lead
defence and seeking out different hackers or trojans or worms designed to steal information from a
company that could hurt the company or its clientele. Being able to defend a company like in the tv
show Mr. Robot makes me excited to study the field and be able to have a career in cyber security.
To be able to qualify to successfully work in a cyber security job I would need a degree in an IT field
such as a bachelor’s in cyber security in Computer Science. You would need to be able to
demonstrate key understandings of network defence, firewall safety protocols and know how to
code in multiple languages in order to create complex algorithms to protect a server from a hack.
At the moment the skills I have include being able to encrypt a hard drive, being able to read code
and find different ways to make programming easier in the long run and finding the cause of most
problems on computers thanks to the teachings from my dad. I’m not yet qualified but I know how
to do most things in the qualification and if I can’t or don’t know how – ill find the answer through
research and perseverance.
Currently I have a 10-step plan on how I’m going to obtain everything necessary to obtain a job in
defence or in game design. The first 4 steps involve me going to Uni to get a degree to further my
knowledge on everything computer related so I can feel confident in my abilities to give answers in
problem solving on computer servers and networks or on the programming side of things. Steps 5-8
involve me getting real world experience so I can start to develop and build a career for the rest of
my life and then steps 8-10 involve me starting my own firm that contracts for multiple companies.
