- I noticed that it is a good thing to show the actual percentage results from teh Myers Briggs test, by seeing others Assignment 1. 
- Need to get the actual percentage results as a screenshot (luckily I saved the page for offline use to preserve all the POST data, insteading of re-taking the test and possibly getting a different personality altogether)
- It's really annoying having to update the navigation code on all 5 pages everytime there is an update. It would be great to have some sort of include widget type functionality with github pages. Need to look into that
- Getting the reports to be in PDF format means they can be linked to from the site with ease.
- Speak with Justin about what hardware potential this DCMS could have for tracking darts automatically dealing with scoring (kind of like how 10 pin bowling is now)
