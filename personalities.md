### Joshua Laver
- Myers-Briggs Type Indicator – ESTP "The Entrepeneur"
- Learning Style - Verbal Learner
- Big 5
  - Openness – 31%;
  - Conscientiousness – 37.5%;
  - Extraversion – 87.5%;
  - Agreeablenes – 52%
  - Neuroticism – 60%;

After taking the tests, I have found that all three agree with one thing in common – that I 
am a very verbal and extraverted person while still staying grounded and remaining calm when put 
under lots of pressure. To me these tests give me courage and confidence because they tell me 
that all the areas that I usually have doubts in I actually excel at. For instance, in the 16 Personality
test I got Entrepreneur, and in the big 5 I got Ocean which both have extraverted and
sociable as the biggest parts of them. Being able to say I relate to the likes of Samuel L Jackson
and Nicolas Sarkozy the ex-president of France gives me hope that I can speak well in front
of others when I thought I had major stage fright issues. 
When it comes to working in teams and groups, I have always found myself
to be confident and try to lead the group. I have always found myself in situations like at
my current job where even though I don’t have the title of manager or supervisor I’m still helping 
to run the back of venue teams to make sure everything gets done. I feel I may butt heads with
people at times but that’s only because I want things to get done well and not at the bare minimum. 

### Tim Power
- Myers-Briggs Type Indicator – INFJ-A "The Advocate"
- Learning Style – Tactile/Kinesthetic
    - Auditory –20 %;
    - Visual – 35%;
    - Tactile – 45%;
- Big 5
    - Openness – 69%;
    - Conscientiousness – 77%;
    - Extraversion – 48%;
    - Agreeableness – 54%
    - Neuroticism – 58%;

The learning style test was very accurate for the way I like to learn but I wouldn’t say it’s the only
way I learn, I get a lot out of reading and YouTube videos if I want to know how to do something but
I would say being shown in person and doing it with feedback definitely helps with my progression.
The Myers Briggs Test (16 personalities) labels me as the “Advocate” Introverted unless the topic of
discussion is something, I am passionate about or am invested in. I have good leadership capabilities
and can be assertive when required. I believe that I have good morals and I try to plan as best
possible to achieve my goals.

### Justin Reid
- Myers-Briggs Type Indicator – INTJ "The Architect";
- Learning Style 
    - Auditory – 30%;
    - Visual – 45%;
    - Tactile – 25%;
- Big 5
  - Openness – 92%;
  - Conscientiousness – 79%;
  - Extraversion – 65%;
  - Agreeablenes – 50%
  - Neuroticism – 69%;

The tests have me labelled as a driven person with high standards and high expectations
of others. I agree mostly with this but also feel that would paint someone as a bit of a
headstrong bully, so am cautious to ensure I’m respectful and understanding with how I
treat the people I work with, and rather than simply take charge, submit my opinion and
allow it to be evaluated fairly against everyone else’s. My traits will contribute to the group
project being of a high standard and completed as per requirements.

### Nathaniel Rogers
- Myers-Briggs Type Indicator – INFP “The Mediator” 
- Learning Style - Visual Learner 
- Big 5
  - Openness – 79% 
  - Conscientiousness- 50% 
  - Extraversion – 48% 
  - Agreeableness – 69% 
  - Neuroticism – 56%

With my result as the Mediator I have found it rings true throughout all projects, personal and professional, that I excel in organising the workloads and ensuring the people in the project have responsibilities they feel are acheivavble. I usually end up with the technical jobs because of my skills as a programmer. Thinking logically is very natural for me, so it makes sense that programming is an extension of my normal thinking process. As a visual learner thinking things through usually results in rough sketches drawn on scratch paper, which also can double as rough documentation planning which is a happy coincidence.

### Justin Turner
- Myers-Briggs Type Indicator – ENTP "The Inventor"
- Learning Style - Auditiory/Visual Learner
- Creativity Test Result: 58.29 creativity score

The results of the personality tests indicate I am extraverted, intuitive, thoughtful, perceptive, and
learn best through a visual/ auditory method. I believe this is accurate to my personality, I often
thrive in group scenarios and don’t have any difficulty speaking my mind, and can usually spot
potential issues/ opportunities when in the planning stages of a task. I do sometimes play the devils
advocate too often and need to ensure I am remaining cohesive for the group. From past
experience, I definitely understand concepts a lot quicker when someone presents them to me
visually, and often find myself referring to videos in learning scenarios. I also have found that
repeating things to myself or using mnemonics helps me to remember things a lot easier. The
creativity test indicated that I was slightly above average in creativity, and I would agree with that
score as I think I am creative only in certain situations, or when I spend a decent amount of time
considering something.
