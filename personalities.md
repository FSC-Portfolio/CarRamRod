The tests have me labelled as a driven person with high standards and high expectations
of others. I agree mostly with this but also feel that would paint someone as a bit of a
headstrong bully, so am cautious to ensure I’m respectful and understanding with how I
treat the people I work with, and rather than simply take charge, submit my opinion and
allow it to be evaluated fairly against everyone else’s. My traits will contribute to the group
project being of a high standard and completed as per requirements.

### Nathaniel Rogers
- Myers-Briggs Type Indicator – INFP “The Mediator” 
- Learning Style - Visual Learner 
- Big 5
  - Openness – 79% 
  - Conscientiousness- 50% 
  - Extraversion – 48% 
  - Agreeableness – 69% 
  - Neuroticism – 56%

With my result as the Mediator I have found it rings true throughout all projects, personal and professional, that I excel in organising the workloads and ensuring the people in the project have responsibilities they feel are acheivavble. I usually end up with the technical jobs because of my skills as a programmer. Thinking logically is very natural for me, so it makes sense that programming is an extension of my normal thinking process. As a visual learner thinking things through usually results in rough sketches drawn on scratch paper, which also can double as rough documentation planning which is a happy coincidence.

### Justin Turner
- Myers-Briggs Type Indicator – ENTP - "The Inventor"
- Learning Style - Auditiory/Visual Learner
- Creativity Test Result: 58.29 creativity score
